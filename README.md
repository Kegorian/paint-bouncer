### A quick example game to get to grips with Libgdx and Box2D.
To play the game you need to select the right colour before the ball hits the platform. If the ball touches a platform and it is not the correct colour you will lose a life, until you have none left.

*Mechanics are taken and adapted from: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cegames.bouncyNew So give their game a look.*
